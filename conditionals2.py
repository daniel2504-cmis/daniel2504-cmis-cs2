#In this game, you are a detective who is trying to find the murderer who killed Arthas. The killer could be one of the five people who was with Arthas at home. You are given three chances to find any evidences and afterward you will need to choose one of the five people that will be the criminal. However, there are many obstacles while your finding the evidence such as solving problems, random luck, and persuading people to talk. Hopefully, you solve this mysterious crime as a great detective.

#Actual Story: The cop was an old friend of Arthas, he planned to kill him for a long time. He came house at 3:00am and turned on the Heater to make the body died at 5:00am. Afterward, he camebacks at 5:00am, pretending he was like coming for research and actually removed all the evidence. For that reason, If you go to the police car, there is the knife that killed Arthas. The cop said there was no evidence at the first, which means it was lie. In A. C room, there is plumber's checklist that he fixed at 3:00am persuaded to the cop that it is very cold. (Nobody could here Arthas screaming, because it was raining) In Arthas's room, you can suprisingly see a picture that there is Arthas and fat man, but the face is ripped up. (The cop removed his picture to make like he never knew Arthas)(From here you can find that the criminal is one of the male, not female).

#Noah : A little helpful if you understand what it means.
#Dawit: Makes a lot of confusion
#Jaina : less helpful

print """12:00 am, Chiang Mai Thailand, small house.
Cop: "Good Morning Detective it is nice to see you."                                                                                                                                               You: "Good Morning, can you tell me any information before I start to investigate?"
Cop: "Yes sir, the murderer is a clever one we couldn't find any evidences. The person who was killed is Arthas. We found his body yesterday 5:00 am and he was killed by a knife getting through his throat. His body was very warm, so we could tell it didn't been that long after he died."
You : "Who was with him at house?"

Cop: There was five people. His father, Noah Ma, his old friend, Jaina Proudmoore, the homeowner, Steven Lee, his girlfriend, Emma Skywalker, and plumber, Dawit Cho. Five people looks all inocent."
You: "Ofcourse, they are. Lets go look at them."

At night, you need to decide who is the killer and you have three chances to find evidences, you can ask two people and go to one location. Good luck!"""
